This file contains a description of each file in this repo, and the skills learned from. Only files that can demonstrate useful/worthwhile progress are included.

'Chi2_fit_to_data.py' - Python script that computes the Chi-squared value of a set of bivariate data
      > Skills learned:
        - Intro to arrays, replacement fields, measures of statistical relevance
        
'Curve_fit.py' - Using Least-Squares-Fit-Regression(LSFR) to define a function
      > Skills learned:
        - Defining a function, better proficiency with matplotlib, how to learn a set of functions quickly.

'Boltzmann.py' - Used for a lab experiment to determine the value of Boltzmann's constant and absolute zero. 
      > Skills learned:
        - Synthesising previous skills, introduction to pandas module and the dataframe (df) storage type

'pytorch 1 - tensors.py' - The start of my endeavour to learn and be able to fluidly use Machine Learning techniques. 
   # "Why pytorch and not tensorflow?
   # pytorch is less automated, I am aiming to get a fuller understanding of how using machine learning actually
     works in practice, so that I can independently use it for any project I decide to apply it to."
      > Skills learned
        - Understanding what a tensor object is in pytorch, broadcasting rules for tensors, advantages of tensors over arrays, some basic ML concepts 
        (weighting, averaging over data sets by using  multi-dim tensors)
