This project was for the purpose of investigating the transition temperature and the nature of the phase transition in the Meier-Saupe model.

Key Skills:

- code acceleration via flattening (numba takes numpy loops and precompiles them into C++)
  - This can lead to a 6-7x speedup
- Monte-Carlo simulation methods
- Creating gifs from python scripts and MPL outputs.
